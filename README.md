# Olfactory Bulb Model 


This repository contains the simulation code and results for the olfactory bulb model used in my master's 
research paper titled "Computational Tools for the Simulation and Analysis of Spike Trains". The paper 
replicates the plots and results of a model by [Li and Cleland (2017)](#references) and also explores it 
by modifying initial random seed and connectivity parameters. The orignal model can be found 
in [ModelDB](https://modeldb.science/232097).
