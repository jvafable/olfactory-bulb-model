# Olfactory Bulb Model 


This repository contains the simulation code and results for the olfactory bulb model used in my master's 
research paper titled "Computational Tools for the Simulation and Analysis of Spike Trains". The paper 
replicates the plots and results of a model by [Li and Cleland (2017)](#references) and also explores it 
by modifying the initial random seed and connectivity parameters. The orignal model can also be found 
in [ModelDB](https://modeldb.science/232097). 

The paper illustrates a workflow for running spiking neuron network simulations written for [NEURON](#references), a popular simulation environment for modeling networks of neurons, by interfacing simulations through Python, a popular high-level programming language, and performing statistical analyses through R, a programming language for statistical computing and data analysis.
