# Olfactory Bulb Model 

## Overview 

This repository contains the simulation code and results for the olfactory bulb spike train model used in my master's research paper titled "Computational Tools for the Simulation and Analysis of Spike Trains". 

The paper aims to illustrate a workflow for running spiking neuron network simulations written for NEURON, a popular simulation environment for modeling networks of neurons ([NEURON 2024](#references)), by interfacing simulations through Python, a popular high-level programming language, and performing statistical analyses through R, a programming language for statistical computing and data analysis.

This was achieved by replicating the plots and results of a model by [Li and Cleland (2017)](#references). 
It also explores the model by modifying the initial random seed and connectivity parameters. 
The orignal model may be found in [ModelDB](https://modeldb.science/232097). 



### Spike Trains

To be clear, this repository contains a model for simulating **spike trains** based on the neuron model by  [Hodgkin and Huxley (1952)](#references). This is a standard model used in computational neuroscience. It 
is a different neuron model compared to the popular perceptron-based neuron model used in modern artificial intelligence and deep learning. A brief high-level explanation follows to help provide context.

In Computational Neuroscience, a fundamental area of research is focused on the modeling of neuron action potentials (APs), otherwise known as spikes, with sequences of spikes referred to as spike trains \citep{Kass2018}. Physically, spikes are generated by the movement of ions against concentration gradients across a neuron's membrane through ion pumps. This creates a difference in electrical potential between the neuron and the extracellular environment \citep{DayanAbbott2001}. When a neuron's membrane electrical potential rises past a threshold, a spike occurs \citep{DayanAbbott2001}. Neuron spikes can be thought of as identical events, where a spike either occurs or does not occur, exhibiting an \textit{all-or-nothing} behavior \citep{Katz1966}. 

Figure \ref{fig:spike-train} depicts a spike train with multiple spikes occurring within 1000 milliseconds or 1 second. Spikes can be seen rising past some threshold between $-20$ mV to $20$ mV. Although each spike is considered to be identical, note that there are minor differences in peak electrical potential between each  spike. Subthreshold potentials are also visible, but since they do not rise past the threshold, they are not considered spikes. This illustrates the \textit{all-or-nothing} behavior mentioned previously.
